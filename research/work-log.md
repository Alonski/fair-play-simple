# Work Log — Fair Play Simple

## 2026-03-04

### Session 1
- Set up Supabase, auth infrastructure, database migration
- Migrated from npm to bun, replaced ESLint with oxlint

### Session 2
- Visual redesign planned — warm/family aesthetic
- Design tokens applied to foundation (`tailwind.config.js`, `globals.css`)
- Research pivot: studied Fair Play methodology
- Key finding: cards are responsibilities (held), not tasks (completed)
- CPE model, MSC, 5 suits documented in `research/fair-play-system.md`

### Session 3
- **Migrated from Supabase → Firebase** (auth, Firestore, hosting)
- Google sign-in with email allowlist (Alon + Moral)
- Firestore data model: `households/shared` + `cards` subcollection + `users/{uid}`
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions → Firebase Hosting
- Added 81% test coverage (69 tests)

### Session 4
- **Mobile-first UX redesign**
  - Replaced hamburger nav + drawer with fixed bottom tab bar
  - 3 new screens: `MyCardsScreen`, `DealScreen`, `MoreScreen`
  - New `CardRow` component — compact expandable rows
  - Default view is now personal "My Cards" screen
- **Added TanStack Router**
  - Routes: `/` (My Cards), `/deal`, `/more`, `*` → redirect to `/`
  - Refresh works, back button works, deep links work
  - Firebase Hosting rewrite already in place
- **Visual polish — "Warm Paper" aesthetic**
  - AuthScreen: split hero layout with decorative card shapes
  - CardRow: white card surface, shadow, smooth CSS grid expand animation
  - MyCardsScreen: gradient header with partner colour identity
  - DealScreen: proportional balance bar (rose/sage/gold segments)
  - MoreScreen: sectioned settings cards
  - Navigation: rose pill indicator for active tab
  - Background: larger corner blobs
  - `globals.css`: paper grain overlay, expandable-grid utility

### Current state
- Visual polish: **complete**
- Routing: **complete**
- Firebase: **deployed** (CI/CD on push to main)
- Next: UX model fix (real card data, correct categories, Not in Play, Unicorn Space, MSC notes)

## 2026-03-11 / 2026-03-14

### Session 5
- **Playwright E2E test suite** (40 tests, chromium + Pixel 7 mobile)
  - Auth bypass via empty Firebase env vars (`isFirebaseConfigured = false`)
  - `injectStoreData()` helper: sets `card-store` + `game-store` in localStorage via `addInitScript` before navigation
  - 4 spec files: navigation, deal, not-in-play, my-cards
  - All 40 pass; screenshots saved to `test-results/`
  - Added `include: ['src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}']` to `vite.config.ts` so Vitest ignores `e2e/`

- **MSC Notes feature**
  - Repurposed existing `details: LocalizedText` field (already on Card + FirestoreCard + sync)
  - `CardRow`: inline MSC notes section in expanded view
    - Empty → dashed placeholder "Add MSC notes…"
    - Click → textarea, auto-save on blur via `useCardStore.getState().updateCard()`
    - Saved → styled amber note block, click to re-edit
    - Amber "MSC" indicator in collapsed card header when note exists
  - `CardModal`: relabeled from "Details" → "MSC Notes", made optional (removed required validation)
  - 5 new E2E tests in `e2e/msc-notes.spec.ts`
  - Fixed bug: CardModal previously required `details.en/.he` which broke editing all 100 official cards

### Session 5b — Production Readiness (same day, continued)
- **24 production readiness tasks** completed across 6 batches
- 3-agent codebase audit (sync/data, UX, architecture) identified blockers/warnings
- Interview-driven planning: soft delete, persistent history, dark mode, Gemini translation
- **Batch 1**: partner names from store, category labels, time formatting, Deal link
- **Batch 2**: soft delete (`status: 'deleted'`), NIP fix, auth error handling + read-only mode, SyncService listener leak, seeding race fix
- **Batch 3**: history system (Firestore subcollection, ConfirmDialog, Deal/Reset snapshots, MoreScreen history UI with restore)
- **Batch 4**: SyncStatusBar, styled delete dialog, dark mode (CSS custom properties + `@custom-variant dark`)
- **Batch 5**: CI deploys Firestore rules, favicon + PWA manifest
- **Batch 6**: Gemini translation service + translate buttons in CardModal
- **Bug found**: CSS `@import` ordering broke stylesheet when `@custom-variant` was placed before font import — fixed
- **E2E gap identified**: tests check DOM elements but don't validate visual rendering — broken CSS passes all tests

### Current state
- Production readiness: **complete** (24/24 tasks)
- E2E tests: **20 passing** (chromium)
- Firebase AI Logic: **enabled** (Gemini Developer API on Spark plan)
- Known issue: E2E screenshots don't validate visual correctness
- Next: two-device sync test, dark mode QA, translation QA

### Session 6
- User clarified real MVP scope:
  - English-only for now
  - local-only/offline polish not required yet
  - focus on the real shared app for Alon + Moral
- User removed the dead board/dashboard UI path from `src/`
- Production auth slot mapping had already been updated/deployed:
  - `alonzorz@gmail.com` -> `partner-a`
  - `swaddlesnaps@gmail.com` -> `partner-b`
  - `moralalon@gmail.com` -> `partner-b`
- Frontend review saved to `research/frontend-review-2026-03-29.md`
- Mobile UI polish pass:
  - bottom nav active state redesigned to avoid the old overflowing slab feel
  - dark mode palette warmed and made more legible
  - narrow Deal toolbar layout fixed for mobile
  - dark-mode sign-out button surface fixed on More
- Local emulator workflow corrected:
  - `make dev-emu` banner/docs now use `window.__devSignIn('alonzorz@gmail.com', 'Alon')`
  - docs note that app-side allowlist is skipped in emulators, but Firestore rules still expect an allowlisted email
- Verification:
  - `bun run lint` passed
  - `bun run build` passed
  - headless Playwright screenshots saved to `tmp/review-cli/`
- Claude/assistant handoff saved to `research/claude-code-handoff-2026-03-30.md`
