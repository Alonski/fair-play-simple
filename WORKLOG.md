# Fair Play Deck App - Work Log

## Session 2: Frontend Polish & Claude Handoff (2026-03-30)

### ✅ Completed Tasks
- User-confirmed MVP scope narrowed to English-first shared usage for Alon + Moral
- Dead board/dashboard UI path was removed from `src/`
- Mobile UI polish pass completed:
  - bottom nav active state redesigned
  - dark mode warmed and improved
  - narrow Deal toolbar layout fixed
  - More screen sign-out surface fixed in dark mode
- Local emulator docs/instructions corrected to use `window.__devSignIn('alonzorz@gmail.com', 'Alon')`
- Claude handoff saved to `research/claude-code-handoff-2026-03-30.md`

### 📊 Verification
- `bun run lint` ✅
- `bun run build` ✅
- Headless Playwright screenshots saved in `tmp/review-cli/`

### 📝 Notes
- Do not blindly stage `tmp/` artifacts; there are many scratch screenshots and helper files
- Local emulator/dev ports were cleaned up before handoff; start fresh with `make dev-emu`
